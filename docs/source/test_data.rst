Test Data
=========

ThermogramForge includes a set of test data files for development, testing, and validation purposes.

Generated Test Data
------------------

These files are generated using the scripts in the ``tests`` directory:

**Basic Thermogram Data**

- **basic_thermogram.csv**: Standard thermogram with multiple peaks and moderate noise
  
  - Contains three peaks at approximately 63째C, 70째C, and 77째C
  - Has a linear baseline
  - Includes moderate Gaussian noise (0.01 standard deviation)

**Edge Case Thermograms**

- **sparse_thermogram.csv**: Thermogram with sparse data points
  
  - Contains only 20% of the normal number of points
  - Still maintains a recognizable peak shape

- **noisy_thermogram.csv**: Thermogram with high noise levels
  
  - Contains standard peaks but with high noise (0.2 standard deviation)
  - Tests the robustness of peak detection algorithms

- **flat_thermogram.csv**: Nearly flat thermogram (baseline only)
  
  - Contains only a linear baseline and minimal noise
  - Used to test behavior when no significant peaks are present

- **single_peak_thermogram.csv**: Thermogram with a single sharp peak
  
  - Contains one narrow peak at 65째C
  - Used to test simple peak detection

Generating Test Data
------------------

To regenerate test data, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python tests/generate_test_data.py

This script uses the utility functions in ``tests/data_generators.py`` that can also be imported directly for custom test data generation:

.. code-block:: python

    from tests.data_generators import create_basic_thermogram, create_edge_case_thermogram
    
    # Create custom thermogram data
    my_data = create_basic_thermogram(n_points=200, noise_level=0.05)
    
    # Create specific edge case data
    noisy_data = create_edge_case_thermogram('noisy', n_points=150)

R Validation Data
---------------

For validating the Python implementation against R, reference data may be found in:

- ``tests/data/r_reference/``: Reference outputs from R's smooth.spline function
- ``tests/data/thermogram_reference/``: Reference thermogram processing results from the R implementation

File Format
----------

All test data files are in CSV format with the following structure:

For thermogram data:

.. code-block:: text

    Temperature,dCp
    45.0,0.123
    45.5,0.128
    ...

For reference data:

.. code-block:: text

    x,y,fitted
    45.0,0.123,0.125
    45.5,0.128,0.130
    ...
