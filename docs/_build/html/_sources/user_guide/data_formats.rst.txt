Data Formats
============

ThermogramForge expects specific file formats and data structures for successful analysis. This section outlines the requirements for your input data.

Supported File Types
--------------------

The application currently supports the following file formats for uploading thermogram data:

*   **CSV (Comma Separated Values):** ``.csv`` files
*   **Excel Spreadsheets:** ``.xls`` and ``.xlsx`` files

Data Structure and Required Columns
-----------------------------------

ThermogramForge can handle data organized in two main ways:

1.  **Single Sample per File:**
    Each file contains data for only one thermogram sample. The file must include at least two columns:
    *   **Temperature:** A column containing the temperature readings (e.g., in Celsius or Kelvin). The exact column header should ideally be "Temperature".
    *   **Differential Heat Capacity (dCp):** A column containing the corresponding heat capacity measurements. The specific header for this column is less critical as long as it's clearly identifiable.

2.  **Multiple Samples per File:**
    A single file can contain data for multiple samples. In this case, the data should be organized with pairs of columns for each sample:
    *   **Temperature Column (e.g., "T1", "T2"):** A temperature column for each sample, often denoted with a prefix/suffix indicating the sample ID (e.g., "T[SampleID]").
    *   **dCp Column (e.g., "1", "2"):** A corresponding heat capacity column for each sample, often identified by the sample ID itself (e.g., "[SampleID]").

    The application attempts to automatically detect these "T[ID]/[ID]" pairs. For example, columns named "T_SampleA" and "SampleA" would be treated as the temperature and dCp data for "SampleA". Ensure your column naming follows a consistent pattern for reliable detection.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Temperature Column:** The presence of a column identifiable as "Temperature" is crucial, especially for applying temperature range filters during the upload process.
*   **Column Headers:** Ensure your files have clear and consistent column headers on the first row.
*   **Data Integrity:** Data should be numeric and free of non-numeric characters within the data rows for Temperature and dCp columns. Missing values might be handled, but extensive gaps can affect analysis results.
