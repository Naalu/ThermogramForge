Installation
============

This section guides you through installing ThermogramForge on your local machine. It assumes you have Python (>= 3.8) and `git` installed.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher is recommended. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   **Git:** Required for cloning the repository. You can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **Pip:** Python's package installer, usually included with Python.

Steps
-----

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project repository:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/Naalu/ThermogramForge.git
        cd ThermogramForge

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies separately.

    .. code-block:: bash

        python -m venv venv

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    *   On **macOS and Linux**:

        .. code-block:: bash

            source venv/bin/activate

    *   On **Windows**:

        .. code-block:: bash

            venv\Scripts\activate

    Your terminal prompt should change to indicate the active environment (e.g., `(venv)`).

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Install all the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install -r requirements.txt

Next Steps
----------

With ThermogramForge installed, you can now proceed to the :doc:`quickstart` guide to launch the application and begin analyzing data.
